game ideas
 - a plaftformer game featuring our mascot the ninja dragon (maybe not in his ms paint glory)

 - LET'S DO IT DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!



-Wings double jump

-Fire breath attack

-Scales act as defence/armour and can be collected throughout the game's world and be used in safe zones to upgrade player's armour

-Scales can also be used as a "shotgun" blast attack BUT reduce both the player's armour and health

-Scales + fire breath = melting "shotgun" blast

-Swing spiked tail for attacks in different directions

-Double jump + downwards swing for powerful crowd attack

-Double jump + downwards swing + fire breath = hell
